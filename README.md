# iOS-App-Dylib-Patches

I use these with LiveContainer.

Telegram.m doesn't do anything yet, but it's intended to make Telegram launch under LiveContainer (I think there are issues with CloudKit)

The WhatsApp entitlement removal patch was necessary for me to be able to launch WhatsApp under LiveContainer

The rest are ad blockers
